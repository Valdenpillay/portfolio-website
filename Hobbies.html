            <p>
                Undertook a comprehensive restoration project in memory of my grandfather, focusing on painting, panel beating, and the repair of both mechanical 
                and electrical components of this timeless classic. The project included a full respray, upgraded rims, enhanced sound 
                system, and complete mechanical refurbishment, covering brakes, suspension, chassis, gearbox, and clutch. Additionally, 
                all auto electrical systems were restored and modernized, featuring the installation of LED daytime running lights and 
                underbody lighting.
