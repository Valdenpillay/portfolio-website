            <h1 class="project-title">Radio Frequency Low Noise Amplifier</h1>
            <p>
                The RF LNA designed and simulated in the AWR environment specifically designed for maximum gain.
                The design frequency of the amplifier was at 254MHz with specifications including a minimum gain
                of 22dB. The active device used was the BFP420F biased at VCE = 2.5V and Ic = 8mA. The rollet 
                stability factor (k) had to be greater than 1 to stabilize the device at the design frequency.
                The L-matching networks was configured to the design frequency at the input and output of the 
                amplifier to ensure maximum power transfer at the characteristic impedance of 50 Ohms. The PCB 
                include all SMD devices except the inductors which were tuned accordingly and via stitching to
                improve signal integrity and noise reduction allowing for shorter return paths as this was a 
                high frequency circuit. The circuit was tested using the Vector Network Analyser (VNA).

            <p>
                The Flame and Temperature sensor module was designed to measure the surrounding temperature as 
                well as to detect the presence of the flame. For temperature sensing a simple thermistor was used
                and the IR flame sensor to detect the presence of the flame. The microcontroller used was the 
                ATMega328P assembled on a break-out board to display temperature readings and the flame sensor 
                state on a 16x2 LCD.

            <p>
                The Light Sensor Cicuit was constructed using the 555 Timer IC to detect the presence of
                light using an LDR and a transistor to switch the speaker on. The sensitivity of the circuit 
                could be varied using a potentiometer to adjust photon impact on the LDR to switch the speaker
                on at different light levels.

            <p>
                The LED 8x8 matrix consists of a total of 64 LEDs based on 8 rows and 8 columns which were
                connected to the digital ports of the microcontroller. The pins can be correctly sinked and 
                sourced to switch any LED or multiple LEDs on or off to create distinct patterns. The KiCad 
                software was used in the design of this circuit.

            <h1 class="project-title">AC/DC Power Supply</h1>
            <p>
                The AC/DC Power Supply was designed to produce a variable DC voltage from the AC mains supply. 
                The circuit was designed using NI Multisim and NI Ultiboard and then placed into a housing with
                a toggle switch, an LED, a potentiometer and an analog voltage meter. A prototype was constructed
                and tested to read output values of the circuit. The final product was constructed and produced an
                accurate reading related to the protoype results. The power supply did not make use of a transformer
                which reduced circuit costs. A fuse was calculated and added to protect the downstream circuitry.

            <p>
                The Cosel LEB225F-2405 switching power supply unit is a precise power supply unit producing an average 
                power output of 225W. It consists of multiple 24V outputs to run the internal fan as the unit is
                convection cooled. The 24V outputs also run the X-axis stepper motor, the Y-axis stepper motor and the 
                sewing motor which is a 24V AC servo motor where the switching is required. The 5V output is used to 
                power the processor which stores the digital designs and contains the machine user controls such as 
                memory reading/deletion, design programming, stop and start controls.

                The Audio Amplifier was designed in the NI Multisim and NI Ultiboard environment with minimal board 
                space to work with. The audio amplifier has multiple amplification stages to maximise gain of the 
                input signal. A douvle sided PCB was constructed with minimum vias to improve signal integrity.

            <p>
                The Motor Driver circuit was designed to ease the implementation in the revolution counter project
                which used the LN293D IC. The Ic uses the PWM signal to vary motor speed and an embedded H-Bridge 
                circuit to control the direction of rotation of the motor. The IC was used to control two motors 
                simultaneously which was efficient to carry out the control aspect of the project. The simple 
                design of the board had also improved troubleshooting if problems occured due to the pin labelling.

                The Resonant Band Pass Filter was a simple PCB Design to filter out unwanted signals that did
                not fall within the relevant band. A single-sided PCB had to be designed for this application.

            <p>
                The STM32 Break-out board was designed in KiCad and a power supply IC was used to power the 
                STM32 chip. A b-type usb port had been configured to ease programming purposes to make the ST-Link 
                debugger redundant. This forms the basis of embedded systems as the board can be further devloped to 
                include more GPIO ports, Alternate function ports and Analog functions. Further embedded sytem 
                projects are illustarted in the electronic projects section of the website.
