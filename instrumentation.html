            <h1 class="project-title">Boiler Level Control System</h1>
            <p>
                Boiler Level Control system using PID controllers to maintain the Setpoint at 40. The system
                consists of a feedwater flow rate controlled by the LCV. The flow transmitter (FT) measures
                inlet flow rate. At the outlet the steam produced is measured by an additional FT summed to 
                the Flow Controller (FC). The Boiler level is measured by the Level transmitter (LT) connected
                to the Level Controller (LC) and summed to the FC as well.

            <p>
                Tank Level Control using simple On Off Control Technique. The controller switches the Level
                Control Valve (LCV) On and Off to maintain the desired setpoint at 50 within the tank. The 
                system is fast acting and initiates constant action on the Final Control Element (FCE). This
                control technique is simple but not recommended due to poor control precision and increased 
                wear and tear on the FCE.

            <h1 class="project-title">PID Tank Level Control</h1>
            <p>
                Tank level control using a PID controller. The PID controller is tuned to attain the 
                proportional gain (Kp) value as 10, the Integral gain (Ki) value as 1 and the Derivative 
                gain (Kd) value as 1. This control technique offers greater precision with less overshoot and 
                a reduced time to reach steady-state. The controller output (CO) indicates a gradual increase or 
                decrease which reduces wear and tear on the FCE. The addition of a filter would improve the 
                CO thus further reducing wear and tear on the FCE.

            <p>
                This system monitors pressure in a pipeline using a differential pressure transmitter. The readings
                are displayed on an HMI and logged in real-time for analysis. Safety thresholds trigger alarms
                and automatic shutdown mechanisms.

            <p>
                This project controls the flow rate of liquid through a pipe using a control valve and feedback
                from a flow transmitter. A PID controller adjusts the valve to maintain the desired flow setpoint
                despite disturbances.
